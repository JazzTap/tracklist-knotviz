I was going to watch Vi Hart's Child (particle snow, polytonal choirs, clipping polyhedra). Wound up in Microsoft's loft (nice ceiling, one of those extruded parametric meshes; an impractical expanse compared to Microsoft's own house).

Can't get eleVR stuff to work on Windows headset. We watched a 3d vlog containing a pitch for Bicameral Mind recited from a laptop screen (in real time), inside an Edge frame in the loft, which had an impractical notion of fullscreen. It was equally possible to pan around inside the vlog and inside of the house.

This had the actual sense of 'your room in my room (in your room in my room)' that another defunct demo did. Minus the frustration, mis-connecting doorways is a definite possibility.
