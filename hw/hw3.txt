ch2

can anybody actually grok tensors from a forest of ellipses?
    high-dimensional shapes would be nice - lots of corners, many kinds of adjacency -

    but dot products (and crossproducts) are more likely to yield decent 'similarity'
        is 2d graph embedding w/ link strength 'faithful'? 3d?

ch3

enjoyment is for casual engagement!
    what?

    true, obviously. but not only.

ch5

control for channel's stimulus intensity in choosing scale of bound axis
    application for logscale stuff

    removing information, e.g. binning, creates distinctions
    (which may even be true - try a logscale)

adjacency effects on color are intricate
