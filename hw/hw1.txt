immersion

Finding character leitmotifs in my slightly randomized playlists. E.g. while playing a 200-hour RPG with direct movement and swooshy cloaks and characters situated in their political worlds, or while arranging scenes of the same (up to textual fidelity) in my head.

Loggerheads not requiring unusual stubbornness or unprecedented foolishness are good. Relationships may progress through other milestones. Assonance with some minimal NPC AI or other kind of persistence is important.


(Representing domain-specific rich input works, too. Verifying an interesting algorithm is not unlike verifying an amusing arrangement of stakes.)


analysis

Bolting together a character sheet, especially by consulting reams of items, or trying to simulate blast radii and synergies. Arranging existing items together. Constructing a piece that finishes a set.

Wish that writing broke down like data pipelines do, eventually. Writing for the absent interpreter goes badly. I can't work without any feedback loop. I'll learn from examples, and extract the minimal representation.
